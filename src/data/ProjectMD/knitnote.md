Knit Note is a fiber-arts project tracker where users can store data on their knit or crochet projects such as the name of the yarn or pattern used, start and end dates, category of item, and more.

The app connects to a relational database to ensure reliable storage of data and utilizes RESTful API endpoints to separate frontend logic from backend data handling.
