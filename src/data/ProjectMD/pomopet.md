PomoPet is a text-based productivity app that combines virtual pet simulation with a Pomodoro timer to allow users to grow their pets through focus sessions.

Some core features include file-based persistence to allow saving between sessions, simple ASCII graphics, RNG systems inspired by Dungeons and Dragons for competitions, and scaling difficulty.
