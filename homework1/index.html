          <h2>My Life at School and Work</h2>
          <p>I'm a student currently learning <strong>front-end web development</strong> at General Assembly.</p>
          <p>I work part time at my local <strong>Gamestop.</strong> Although its not a job I want to make my career - its great for me while I'm in school because I get to constantly have conversations with people who love games as much as I do. </p>
          <p>I also do a little modeling for <a href="https://www.vyrusco.com/" id="vyrus">Vyrus</a>, my friend's gaming apparel company!</li>

          <h2>A Few of My Hobbies</h2>
          <p>I get bored easily and hop from hobby to hobby regularly, but here are some that I've been into recently:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Video games have been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember! Nintendo games have always been my favorites, but I recently built my own PC so I've been playing a lot of Overwatch, Danganronpa, Slime Rancher, and lots more.</li>
            <li><strong>Anime/Manga:</strong> I really enjoy watching anime/reading manga - my favorite series being Gurren Lagann.</li>
            <li><strong>Art:</strong> I've always had a big love for drawing and I'm currently trying to teach myself how to create pixel art!</li>
            <li><strong>Plushies:</strong> Whenever I have the money to spare,I love going to the arcade in my town and playing the crane machines to add more plush babies to my family.</li>
          </ul>
